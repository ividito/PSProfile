# PSProfile
My Powershell Profile

Super simple, requires one added module to work (https://github.com/joonro/Get-ChildItemColor)

Of note are the Test-Administrator, touch, rps, and prof commands, as well as colorization of ls and l command outputs.

rps is essentially a restart command for PS, it will open a new instance and exit the original.
touch is a clone of the Linux touch command
prof will open an editor for your profile, and make a new profile if one does not exist
